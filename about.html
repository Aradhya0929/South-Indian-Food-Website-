    <h2>Welcome to South Indian Dosa Corner</h2>
    <p>
      At South Indian Dosa Corner, we bring the rich flavors of South India to your plate.  
      From crispy dosas to fluffy idlis and flavorful uttapams, our recipes are inspired by the authentic kitchens of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in serving fresh, hygienic, and homemade-style food with a touch of tradition. 
      Our ingredients are carefully selected, and each item is made with love and care, just like you’d find at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re grabbing a quick bite or sitting down for a full meal, we promise a warm and satisfying experience every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for making us a part of your day!
